# 🧳 Travel Advisor Chatbot

This is a friendly, AI-powered Travel Advisor chatbot built with Python and Gradio. It helps users plan vacations by suggesting destinations based on their preferences like region, destination type (Beach, Mountain, etc.), and travel style (Budget, Luxury, Family-friendly, Romantic).

Once preferences are selected, users can chat naturally with the bot and receive destination recommendations that align with their choices—without needing to repeat them in the conversation. The interface is simple, interactive, and styled with light blue tones to give a relaxing, travel-inspired feel.

🔧 **Tech Stack**: Python, Gradio, GROQ API (LLaMA-3 Model)  
🌍 **Use Case**: Travel planning, destination discovery, tourism recommendation systems
